BrAPI Java is a [Breeding API (BrAPI)](https://brapi.org) implementation written in Java. It contains all data objects as well as a client interface that can be utilised using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and server inferfaces that are designed to be used with the [Restlet](https://restlet.talend.com/) library.
